    "This report presents a preliminary analysis of Megaline's 'Surf' and 'Ultimate' prepaid plans. The primary goal is to determine which of these two plans generates more revenue. By analyzing the behavior of a sample of 500 customers from 2018, we can gain insights that will help the commercial department make informed decisions about the allocation of the advertising budget."

    "The analysis of the monthly usage patterns reveals interesting differences and similarities between the 'Surf' and 'Ultimate' plan users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minutes: Both 'Surf' and 'Ultimate' users have very similar average monthly call durations (around 429-430 minutes). The distributions, as seen in the histogram, are also quite similar and are right-skewed, indicating that most users make fewer calls, while a smaller number of users make significantly more. Both groups are well within their respective plan limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Messages: On average, 'Ultimate' users send more messages (37.6) than 'Surf' users (31.2). However, both groups are well below the generous limits of their plans. The distribution for messages is also heavily right-skewed for both plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Usage: 'Ultimate' users, on average, consume slightly more data (17.3 GB) than 'Surf' users (16.7 GB). The interesting point here is that the average 'Surf' user's data consumption is above their 15 GB monthly allowance, suggesting that overage charges for data are common for this plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revenue: The average monthly revenue from 'Ultimate' users ($72.31) is higher than that of 'Surf' users ($60.71). The revenue for 'Ultimate' users is very consistent, centered right at their $70 monthly fee. In contrast, the revenue from 'Surf' users varies significantly. While the base fee is only $20, many 'Surf' users pay much more due to overage charges, especially for data. This is evident in the wide, right-skewed distribution of revenue for the 'Surf' plan."

    "# 5. Overall Conclusion\n",
    "This preliminary analysis has provided valuable insights into the usage patterns and profitability of the 'Surf' and 'Ultimate' plans. Here is a summary of the key findings and a final recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- 'Ultimate' Plan is More Profitable on Average: The average monthly revenue per user for the 'Ultimate' plan is approximately $72.31, which is consistently higher than the 'Surf' plan's average of $60.71 per user. Our statistical test confirmed that this difference is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Surf' Plan's Revenue is Driven by Overage: While the 'Surf' plan has a low entry price of $20, a substantial portion of its revenue comes from users exceeding their plan limits, particularly for data. The average 'Surf' user consumes more data than the 15 GB included in their plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Ultimate' Users are Comfortable: 'Ultimate' plan users rarely exceed their generous plan limits. Their monthly revenue is, therefore, very predictable and stable, hovering right around the $70 monthly fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regional Differences in Revenue: We found a statistically significant difference in revenue between users in the NY-NJ area and other regions. This could be a subject for further investigation to understand the drivers behind this difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation\n",
    "Based on this analysis, the 'Ultimate' plan consistently generates more revenue per user than the 'Surf' plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I recommend that the advertising budget should be focused more heavily on promoting the 'Ultimate' plan. While the 'Surf' plan has a wider user base and can be profitable due to overage charges, the 'Ultimate' plan provides a higher and more predictable revenue stream per customer. Highlighting the value and peace of mind offered by the 'Ultimate' plan's generous limits could be an effective marketing strategy."
